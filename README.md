# Info-script

This is an info script for Linux based OS. Copy code to txt or download code. 
We need to make it executable. So let's do Â that:
```
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x infoskr
```
U can do it in GUI as well:
Right click file, go to properties and turn on executable as program.

U can right click it and then click execute or do it in terminal by typing:
```
./infoskr
**OR**
bash infoskr
```
Have fun!
